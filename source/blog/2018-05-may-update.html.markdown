##A Trip to America##

America, here we come! Our family is planning a trip to the States for this
holiday season. By then, it will have been two and a half years since our last
trip home, and we are looking forward to reconnecting with family, friends, and
supporters!

Our trip will last from early November to late February. We are planning to stay
with family, but it is looking like we will need a vehicle that can accommodate
four car seats/boosters during our time in
Texas (November, and also mid January through late February). If we can't borrow/buy
a vehicle, we are looking into leasing a vehicle from an organization that
leases to missionaries on furlough. So if you know of any good options,
be sure to [contact us](contact) and let us know!

##Good and Evil##

The [Good and Evil](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/2018/03/translation-complete/) project is coming along well. We are coming down the home
stretch on proofing the translation, and are mainly working on the layout now. We need to
have this project wrapped by the beginning of CMO on July 12th, so your prayers
would be appreciated!

##Carpathian Mountain Outreach##

The CMO project is in the same place as the Good and Evil project. Lots of work
to do, and not much time! Pray that we would be able to get all our preparations
done in time, and that God would bless CMO.

More specifically, we are planning a
trip to the Carpathian Mountains for the week of June 11th to scout
out the area we are planning to work in the summer. Our hope is to contact some
of the local authorities and make arrangements for the first couple film showings
of the project.

##Family##

We are currently in the process of renewing our residency permits. So far,
everything has gone without a hitch, and by next month, we should hopefully be
all ready to go for another year.

The pregnancy is also going pretty well, but we would continue to appreciate your
prayers for a healthy mama and baby. The girls are getting bigger and more
helpful by the day, and are looking forward to meeting their baby brother in
August!
