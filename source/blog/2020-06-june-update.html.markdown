##Bible First

I have several things relating to Bible First to report on, so let's get to it!

**Bible First Reprint — English**

I mentioned this last month, but we are in the process of combining the Bible First lessons into a single book. That project is moving along, slowly but surely.

**Bible First Reprint — Ukrainian**

My biggest project for the last month was preparing the updated Ukrainian Bible First files for printing. We hired a designer to do most of the heavy lifting, but that last little bit was still quite a chore! It's kind of like packing your house for a move. At first, things go quickly, but trying to get that last 10% of the stuff in the boxes seems to take forever! Regardless, the job is done, and the printer is doing his thing. Sometime in the next week, we should be taking delivery of our updated Ukrainian lessons!

**Bible First Online**

We are currently using Bible First Online in our ministry, but before we can open it up for others to use, it needs some work. Josh Steele is currently working on that, and while I could jump in and help, I feel taking a step backwards would be more beneficial in the long run. It's been two years since I've done any serious web development, so I've decided to take some time for a little "continuing education" to freshen up my skills before stepping into the fray.

##Coronavirus

In general, the coronavirus situation in Ukraine has improved, and the government has relaxed the quarantine. However, some areas of Ukraine have stricter quarantines than others. Our area of Ukraine is one of the areas where the quarantine has remained more strict, and despite that, we have seen quite the uptick in cases in the last week. And while the situation is far from critical, we definitely don't want it to get out of hand.

##Family

After a cool spring, summer weather has finally arrived, and with it, summer vacation! The girls are almost done with their last few schoolbooks, and then it's time to relax and enjoy the summer!
