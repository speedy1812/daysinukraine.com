Nothing super exciting to report on this month, just lots of nice, steady progress on different projects!

## By Divine Design

The translator and I finished Chapters 8 and 9 last week. Just three more chapters to go!

## Bible First Online

I'm still working on adding answer keys to Bible First Online. Meanwhile, thanks to all the [traveling and speaking](https://ofreport.com/blog/2021-08-19-coming-soon-to-a-neighborhood-near-you/){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} the Steeles have done in America recently, there are a bunch of new people that are excited about using BFO in ministry!

## Documents

The Steeles were not able to renew their residency permits before leaving for the States, so they had to cancel them and will need to start over from scratch. This means applying for visas while they are in America, and then applying for new residency permits once they get back to Ukraine.

At present, I have been working with our attorney and local church in Ukraine to get the letters of invitation and other documents that the Steeles will need to get their visas. Pray that all would go well!

## Family

It's starting to feel a lot like fall. School is in full swing. The trees are changing color. Little by little, cold weather gear is working its way out of storage and into everyday use. First it was hats and mittens, then it was winter coats and warm socks, and now there is a pile of snow pants in the house. Thankfully, it's not quite cold enough for the snow pants yet!

On the baby front, everything is looking good! The baby is now head down, and will hopefully stay that way. Just five weeks to go! Katelin's mom, Patricia, is planning to come for the birth. Our current prayer is that she would be able to come, and that she would arrive before the baby!
