##Carpathian Mountain Outreach

It's hard to believe that we are already looking at CMO 2019 in the rearview
mirror! Four young men from the US and Canada joined us for our summer outreach,
and over the course of four weeks, we hosted film showings in five Carpathian
villages, talked to people on the street, hiked the highest mountain in the
region, passed out 94,000 tracts in five cities, and preached the Gospel in
downtown Lviv. As a result of our efforts, the responses are already rolling in.
Since the beginning of CMO, five people have requested enrollment in our
correspondence course, Bible First, and around 50 have requested a copy of *Good
and Evil.*

In addition to ministry, we also thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the CMO guys
and sharing with them some of the things we have learned in our years on the
field. All of them are interested in
missions work, and some of them may even be joining us in Ukraine in the future!

If you'd like to read more about CMO, I'd encourage you to check out the updates
the guys wrote on the [ETO blog](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/){: target="blank"}. For example, [here is the
report](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/2019/07/the-last-stretch/){: target="blank"} Ralph wrote on
the last week of CMO. Also, be sure to check out the [photo album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10156588229237123&type=3){: target="blank"} for that week.

##Team News

Our teammates, Joshua and Kelsie, are expecting a baby about a week from now.
I'm sure they would appreciate your prayers for a easy birth and a healthy baby!

## Medical

Back in March, I reported that Lydia was likely to need a second surgery to
fully correct her lazy eye. Well, as of her last checkup, Lydia's eyes have
improved to the point that those plans are now on hold. We are now in "wait and
see" mode. If things get worse, Lydia may need the surgery after all, but if
they continue to improve, we may be in the clear!

##Family

After a busy month of summer ministry, we are happy to be a family again! (Daddy
was gone a lot more than usual.) That
said, now that the girls are getting older, they are able to take part in CMO to
a degree. They joined the team a couple times for street ministry, and even went
with us to the mountains once to pass out film invitations!
