##Carpathian Mountain Outreach##

At this point, it is looking like there will be six guys coming for CMO. Four of
them will be coming for the first time, and two of them are veteran CMOers from
CMO 2015. We would appreciate your prayers as we prepare for CMO, as the guys
will be arriving in just under three months!

##Bible First##

For the past couple months, Denise has been busy sending out hundreds of letters
to Bible First students that have fallen off the bandwagon in past years. Her efforts have
been paying off. Multiple students have returned to studying the Bible, and just
this past week, a lady who signed up all the way back in 2006
finally finished the course!

We are also continuing to work on the Bible First website and the translation
of *Good and Evil*. Pray for God to bless our efforts, as we only have three
short months until CMO begins.

##Family##

The biggest family news is that...

> It's a boy!

Despite the fact that we are entering unknown territory,
we are all looking forward to meeting little boy blue! There are still a couple
of pregnancy-related health issues that we are working on, and we would
appreciate your prayers for those.
