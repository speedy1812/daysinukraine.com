Regarding the *Good and Evil* books, they are the books that I mentioned in our [last update](https://daysinukraine.com/2025/05/opportunities-to-give/){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, and a big thanks to everyone that contributed! They are being printed as we speak, so pray that they would be printed without mistakes, and that they would be delivered in time for UGO.

When it comes to the humanitarian aid, for those who wish to get involved financially, there is the opportunity to contribute.

## Family

As if our October wasn't full enough already, our family is excited to be moving to a new house (with a yard!) in late October! In Ukraine, we have always lived in apartments, which worked well enough in the past, but apartment life hasn't been so great for our younger kids. Especially after living in a house while on our last furlough, it has been hard to go back to an apartment. Unfortunately, houses that would be considered fairly typical by American standards are few and far between in Ukraine, but it would seem that we have finally found our needle in a haystack! Moving day is still several weeks out, but we are already starting to pack things up and prepare for the big day.

We are also happy to report that we are considering Lydia to be completely recovered from Lyme as of a few months ago! The path to recovery was long and hard, but we are very thankful that Lydia is back to feeling like her old self again!

On the other hand, I broke my toe about three weeks ago during an air attack on Lviv. I was hurriedly carrying a sleepy child downstairs to our "shelter room" when I slipped on the stairs. The child was fine, but I was not. Thankfully, to my knowledge, my toe was the only casualty that night. Also, it's not a serious break, UGO doesn't require a lot of walking, and it should be healed by moving day. That said, I would appreciate your prayers for a full recovery!
