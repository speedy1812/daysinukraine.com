## Bible First Reprint

It's hard to believe that it's been a year since I [reported on our plans](https://daysinukraine.com/2020/05/may-update/) to reprint the English Bible First lessons, but this time as a single book. The project has been simmering on the back burner, but things are finally picking up steam. I recently finished the job of correcting various typos and incorporating various suggestions that have come in since the last printing. We are working with a designer to finalize the styles for the book, and we've got someone lined up to do the layout once we are done. Hopefully we will be ready to go to press soon!

## Carpathian Mountain Outreach

Thanks to Covid, there will be no Carpathian Mountain Outreach this year, but thanks to several CMO alumni, there will be a [Rocky Mountain Outreach!](https://www.onwardforchrist.org/rocky-mountain-outreach-2021) In fact, it's going on right now! It's exciting to see how others have taken the baton and run with it!

## Family

Our biggest family news is that we are expecting a new baby!

> Looks like someone is blowing bubbles in there!

The due date for the little one is sometime in late November, and so far the reports from the doctor have been mostly positive. The one thing we are keeping an eye on is the placenta. It is currently a bit low, and we are hoping and praying that it will move up and away from the cervix (as it normally does over the course of a pregnancy). At this point, all the kids are rooting for a boy!
