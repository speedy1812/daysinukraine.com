##Carpathian Mountain Outreach

CMO 2020 went great! At least, as far as I can tell! For the first time ever, thanks to COVID-19, I was not a part of CMO at all. Instead, CMO took place in Colorado and was organized by CMO alumni. To see pictures and read reports, you can visit the [Onward for Christ](https://www.facebook.com/onwardforchrist/){: target="_blank"} Facebook page.

##Bible First Reprint

The reprint of the English Bible First lessons is still in progress. Our graphic designer recently came back on the radar and mocked up some initial designs, so that's a step in the right direction.

##Web Development

Web development is also going well. One of the things I recently learned was how to use a new CSS framework called Tailwind that we plan to use in the future. CSS is what makes a website look nice and puts the content of a webpage where it's supposed to go. (If you'd like to see what websites like Amazon or Wikipedia look like without CSS, [click here](https://css-tricks.com/that-time-i-tried-browsing-the-web-without-css/#through-the-style-less-looking-glass){: target="_blank"}.) In the here and now, however, the CSS framework I was using for this blog was going obsolete. And so I was able to put my newfound skills to good use by replacing the old CSS framework for our blog with Tailwind.

##Coronavirus

On the one hand, over the last month, new Coronavirus cases in Ukraine have roughly doubled from about 1,000 per day to 2,000. On the other hand, cases in our area of Ukraine have remained fairly stable. We will see what the future holds.

##Family

While on the subject of sickness, our family got hit by a nasty virus a couple weeks ago. That's one of the reasons this update is later than usual. But we are thankful to be healthy again.

Aside from the time we were sick, it's been nice for us to start getting back together with friends and attending church in person. School has started again, so that's keeping Katelin and the girls busy. Jonathan recently had his second birthday, and Lydia's birthday is right around the corner!
