While in the States, we were glad to be able to meet with most of you face-to-face and update you on the ministry. But for those of you that we weren't able to meet with, here is a [video version](https://vimeo.com/330488145){: target="blank"} of our presentation.

Also, for those of you that like to hear a missionary preach a sermon, here is a
message I shared titled ["Salvation by Works"](https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/daysinukraine/audio/Salvation+by+Works.mp3){: target="blank"}.

##Carpathian Mountain Outreach

Registration for [Carpathian Mountain Outreach 2019](https://cmoproject.org){: target="blank"} has closed, and we have a group of four applicants:
Ralph, Nelson, Kade, and Cornelius. We are very excited about this year's team,
and are praying that God would do great things in the lives of both our group,
and also in the lives of those we reach.

On a practical note, there are a lot of CMO-related preparations that need to be
done before things kick off on June 13th, and we would appreciate your prayers there. One of the bigger things that
needs to be done is a scouting trip to the Carpathian Mountains, which will
likely happen sometime during the week of the 13th of May. The goal of that trip
will be to confirm our target area and schedule the first couple film showings.

##Bible First

Over the past several years, we have been developing an website that will allow
people to study the [Bible First](https://getbiblefirst.com){: target="blank"} course online. While the functionality for
online study is not completely finished, the ability to manage "offline students"
is. (Offline students are people who get printed Bible First lessons through the mail).

Before we get too far with the online functionality, we want to make sure the
offline side of things is working properly, and we are planning to migrate our
students from the old student management application to the new Bible First site
this Wednesday. Pray that everything will go well!

##Good and Evil

This is not something I have been personally involved in, but God has recently
opened the door for our ministry to get copies of Good and Evil into libraries
across Ukraine. You can read more about that over on the [Steele's blog](https://ofreport.com/2019/03/operation-library/){: target="blank"}.

##Residency Permits

Our family is currently in the process of renewing our yearly residency permits.
So far things are going well, but prayers are always appreciated!

##Family

Spring has arrived, and we are happily trading in our winter boots for
sandals! The tulips we planted last fall are blooming, and vegetables are
sprouting up throughout the girls' garden. Katelin and the girls are getting a
lot of school in, and as of a few days ago, Jonathan is scooting across the
floor. Look out, world! The baby is on the move!
