While the blog has been awfully quiet lately, the good news is that it hasn't been
from a lack of things to write about. Let's get started...

##Good and Evil

We had hoped to finalize the files for *Good and Evil* before Carpathian
Mountain Outreach started, but alas, things always take longer than you think.
I actually took my laptop on one of our first trips to the mountains to finish
proofing an updated version of the print file! CMO aside, we were eventually able
to give the printer the green light.

The books were finally delivered toward the end of August around 9:30 in the
evening. A small team of volunteers worked into the wee hours of the morning to
get the books to their final destination. Except that the "final destination" of
these books is not actually our office, but the hands of Ukrainians. And bit by bit, the
*Good and Evil* books are working their way out to their true "final
destination". For more info and pictures, be sure to check out [the post](https://euroteamoutreach.org/blog/2018/08/delivered/){: target="_blank"} on the
ETO Blog!

##Carpathian Mountain Outreach

CMO 2018 was our shortest summer project yet (right about four weeks long), but
with all we managed to pack into it, it was arguably one of our most intense projects! We had a great team of guys, we are exited to see the fruit of the summer's efforts in the months and years ahead!

##Jonathan

Jonathan was born just about a week after the end of CMO. He arrived a few days
early, but thankfully, not before Katelin's mother, Patricia, made it to Ukraine! (Not
sure how we would have done it without her!) All in
all, the birth went well. Jonathan is a healthy little guy, and Katelin is doing well also. That said, Jonathan has definitely not been the most easy-going baby
we've ever had, and he has kept us busy! I'd say he's at least partly to blame
for the lack of a blog post last month!

##Furlough

We will be returning to the States for a visit in just a couple weeks. We will
be in Texas for the month of November, in Colorado for December and the first half
of January, and then back to Texas for a month. We have a lot to do to get
ready, and we would appreciate your prayers for the preparation and a good trip.
The bigger our family gets, the harder it is to pack up our life and move it
to the other side of the world!
