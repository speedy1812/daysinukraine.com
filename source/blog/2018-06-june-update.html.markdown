##Good and Evil

*Good and Evil* is coming down the home stretch! We are hoping to finalize the
files this week, and hopefully by next week, get the presses rolling. Pray for
no mistakes or typos, or at least a few as possible!

##Carpathian Mountain Outreach

CMO starts in just about two weeks! Our scouting trip went well, and we were
able to schedule the first three film showings of CMO. We still have a lot to do to get ready, so I
am trying to work hard and let tomorrow worry about itself. Please pray for God's
blessing on the whole project.

To keep abreast of the action during CMO, be sure to subscribe to the [eReport](https://euroteamoutreach.org/subscribe){: target="_blank"}, and like ETO's page on [Facebook.](https://www.facebook.com/euroteamoutreach){: target="_blank"}

Also, it's highly unlikely that I'll have time to put together a blog post next
month, so we'll see you all again in August. (Although it will likely be late
August, because the baby is due in mid-August!)

##Bible First

Unfortunately, we were not able to finish the website that would have allowed
our students to study through *Bible First* online. We were getting really
close, but then we had to set web development aside to finish *Good and Evil*
and prepare for CMO. Hopefully we'll be able to get back to work later this
year.

On the bright side, enrollment in the paper *Bible First* course has picked up
recently. Also, Maria and Ralph have finished proofing the Spanish translation
of *Bible First*. All we need to do now is format the text for printing, and/or
finish the Bible First website, and Bible First will be available in Spanish!

##Family

Our residency permits were renewed, so we are good to go for another year.

Continue to pray for Katelin's pregnancy and a successful birth. We are down to just over six weeks to
go! Katelin's mother, Patricia, is coming for a month to help out, and we
are hoping that Patricia will get here before the baby does!
