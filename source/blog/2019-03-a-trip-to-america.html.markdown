Once again, it's been awfully quiet on the blog. This time, we'll blame it on
our recent furlough to America! While we had a wonderful time, it was also
very busy as we tried to squeeze everything into about 3.5 short months.
What were we up to, you might ask? Here is the rundown:

##Family

Far and away, the main purpose for our trip was to see family. We had not seen
most of our family in 2.5 years, and I personally had only met 3 of my 8 nieces
and nephews!

We kicked things off with a Rebsch Family reunion. The kids had a lot of fun
with their cousins, despite the fact that many of them were meeting each other
for the first time! Katelin regularly took the kids to their great-grandparent's
 house, and we spent many happy days at Katelin's Aunt Nora's house, helping
 with farm chores and living the country life. And last, but not least, we got
 to spend a lot of time with Katelin's parents, because we stayed at their
 house!

In Colorado, we stayed with my parents, and several of my siblings still live at
home, so we got lots of good family time in there. My brother and his family
live not far away, and the kids loved spending time with the Colorado cousins.
The rest of the family flew in for Christmas, which was the first time the whole
Day clan was together since the last wedding.

##Friends and Supporters

Aside from family, it was good to reconnect with friends and supporters. We were
able to visit all of our supporting churches, as well as see most of our
individual supporters, and share about the ministry in Ukraine, face-to-face.

##Medical

Lydia's eyes began to cross a couple of years ago. (It's hereditary, she gets it
from her dad.) While in the States, Lydia had surgery to correct the crossed
eye. Unfortunately, it looks like she will need a second surgery to fully
correct the problem. (About 20-25% of the time, two surgeries are needed.) We
would appreciate your prayers as we continue to monitor the situation and look
into our options.

##Other Stuff

While some of the things that fall under the "Other Stuff" heading are things
like banking, legal matters, etc, most of the "Other Stuff" is just that: stuff.
While Ukraine has come a long way, there is still a long list of things that
either we can't get in Ukraine, or are just easier and/or cheaper to get in
America. Certain foods, electronics, homeschooling materials, clothes, and
English books were some of the main things. Imagine cramming a year or two's
worth of non-grocery shopping into a few months, packing everything up to ship
to the other side of the world, and you'll start to get the picture!

> That's a lot of stuff! And that wasn't even all of it!

##Back in Ukraine

Despite having a great time in America, our family is happy to be back home in
Ukraine, back to our house, our routine, and our ministry. I hope to be caught
up on several over-due projects by the end of the month, this blog post being one of them, and
start pushing forward on new ministry fronts soon.

Once last thing. If you haven't yet, be sure to check out our new prayer card
on the [About](about) page!
