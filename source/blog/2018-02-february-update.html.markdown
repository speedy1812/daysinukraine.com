##Good and Evil##

*Good and Evil* is coming along nicely. Tolik recently finished translating the
text, and now Josh and I just need to finish proofing it. About 1.5
chapters left to go!

##Bible First##

The two-week coding marathon that Josh and I did recently went well, but there
is still a lot more work left to do. So for the past couple weeks, we have been
getting together to work on the Bible First website three days a week, Wednesday
through Friday. So far, this has been working well for us, and we hope to make
as much progress as possible before CMO starts this summer.

##Family##

Lydia now has her new glasses, and she has adjusted to them quite well. Next
month, we need to go in for another appointment to see how much progress is
being made.

Last, but not least, here is our new family photo! It was taken last fall, but
I've kept forgetting to post it! For the prayer-card version, be sure to click
over to the [About](about) page of our blog.
