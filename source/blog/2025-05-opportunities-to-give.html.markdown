description: A ministry update and worthy causes to give to.

Giving is not something I talk much about here. That said, our family has a giving budget, and we are always on the lookout for worthy causes and individuals to give to. For kindred spirits out there, I would like to make you aware of a couple opportunities for giving that have recently become available.

The first concerns the Chepara family. Serhii Chepara is someone I have known for two decades, and before he was drafted into Ukraine's armed forces, he served alongside us in ministry. In all likelihood, Serhii was killed in action last year while defending his country. Our ministry recently launched a fundraiser to support people like the Chepara family.

The second opportunity relates to [*Good and Evil.*](https://goodandevilbook.com/english/){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} *Good and Evil* is a comic-book-style Bible story book that we have used in ministry over the past 15+ years. I wrote [back in October](https://daysinukraine.com/2024/10/october-update/){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} about the fact that we were nearing the end of our supplies, and we would like to print more. About a month ago, the ministry that publishes Good and Evil launched a fundraiser that would help us do just that.

## Ministry

We recently had a student complete our entire Bible First course in just under a month! At the end, he was disappointed that we didn't have any more courses, but I was able to point him in the direction of some other Bible teaching materials (in audio and video format) that we have produced over the years.

Speaking of Bible First, one of my projects lately has been to work on some long-overdue updates to the Bible First website that will make it easier for coaches to grade their students' lessons.

## Family

I'm happy to report that Lydia continues to make progress on recovering from Lyme! Little by little, she is easing back into doing things that, just a few months ago, would have zapped all her energy for the rest of the day!

As to my health, I finally finished the four-month protocol that I mentioned in our last update. It was a bit rough at times, and I'm currently taking a break from additional treatments to give myself the opportunity to rest and recover.

Just last week, we celebrated the end of our school year! Everyone worked hard, and it's nice for us all to be able to take a break. Unfortunately, the weather has been unusually cool and rainy, so we've been more cooped up at home. Hopefully all this May rain will bring June flowers, and we'll be able to get out and enjoy our summer vacation!
