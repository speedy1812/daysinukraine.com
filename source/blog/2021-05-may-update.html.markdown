description: Making progress on Bible First Online and By Divine Design!

## Bible First Online

Over the past month, we've had a few more people finish Bible First from our [Pioneers group.](https://www.daysinukraine.com/2021/02/february-update/){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} The next step is to release BFO for use in the wild. Right now, the main thing standing in our way is that the legal side of BFO needs to be shored up. (We need terms of service, a privacy policy, and the like.) We are working with a lawyer on the issue, and should be hearing back from him sometime in the next week.

In the meantime, I've been working on filling out the [support documentation](https://docs.biblefirst.online/){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} that the Pioneers and other future BFO coaches will need when using the application. It's not a glamorous job, but someone's got to do it!

## Translation

Now that Josh is back in Ukraine, we are making good progress on our latest translation project: *By Divine Design.* We are almost finished proofing Chapter 5, and then we will have the translator move on to the next couple chapters. There are 12 chapters in all, so we are nearing the halfway point!

## Family

May has finally arrived and brought its flowers with it! We have all been enjoying the warm weather, and some of us even have sunburns to prove it! Ukrainian Easter was the 2nd of May, and the kids had fun coloring eggs and baking [Ukrainian Easter breads.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paska_(bread)){: target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} They then gave most of the bread away to friends and neighbors, along with a few copies of *Good and Evil.*

> Speaking of baking, the girls baked some treats (without recipes!) and organized this tea party.
