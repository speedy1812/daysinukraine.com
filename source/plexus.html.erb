<h1>Plexus</h1>
<p>If you are looking to improve your health, consider the following products:</p>
<p>
  The first one is <%= link_to "Plexus Slim", "https://plexusworldwide.com/katelinday/product/plexus-slim", :target => "_blank" %>. It was designed to help people manage their blood sugar, but many report that it gives them increased energy and clarity of mind. And if the prospect of increased energy doesn’t tempt you, take a look at what else Plexus Slim is good for:
