This site was built using [Middleman 4][middleman].

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to [Joshua Steele][josh-steele] for his help with this project. Much of my code was inspired by (if not copied from) his [Middleman + Gulp][middleman-gulp] repo.

When switching to [Tailwind][tailwind], I found Joonas Kykkänen's [Middleman + Tailwind CSS][mtcss] template very helpful.
